## 📱 About the Website

**Passop** is a simple yet effective password manager that allows users to store their credentials (URL, username/email, and password) securely. The app ensures smooth usability with animations and real-time feedback using Toastify notifications.

All passwords are stored in a **MongoDB Compass** database with encryption applied to ensure basic data protection. This project highlights my ability to build connected frontend-backend systems with a polished UI.

## 📌 Motivation

I created **Passop** to deepen my understanding of React, REST APIs, and data handling using MongoDB. It reflects my ability to design intuitive interfaces, encrypt sensitive data, and manage full-stack workflows. It also demonstrates my interest in building tools that prioritize both security and user experience.
